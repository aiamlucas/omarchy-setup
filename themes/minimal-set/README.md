# Minimal Set Theme — grayscaleNeon

A very small Omarchy theme focused on a pure black terminal with one accent:
- **Neon chartreuse** for anything that maps to ANSI green (e.g. tmux status bar).
- **Bold cyan (1;36)** is remapped to **white** so the path and prompt arrow are bright and readable.
- Everything else stays neutral grayscale.

**Status:** early preview. Only the **Alacritty** color theme is included right now (Omarchy’s default terminal). Other app configs (Waybar, Walker, Hyprland borders, Neovim UI, btop) will come later.
